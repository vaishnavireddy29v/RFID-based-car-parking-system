RFID based Car Parking System is a simple project that offers an efficient car parking 
management system with the help of RFID Technology.
Car parking management in organisations and malls often consists of many tasks like 
issuing tokens, noting the check-in and check-out time, calculating fare and finally 
collecting the amount.
As the number of vehicles are increasing, the problems faced by manual parking 
management system are also increasing.
Such problems can be eliminated to some extent by implementing an intelligent 
parking system where the entry and exit of cars is monitored and payment is made 
easy with sensor technology.
This project deals with an interesting manner of security access based car parking 
system using AT89C51 microcontroller and RFID Technology.
For this project we are going to use Keil MicroVision for software development 
environment and Proteus for simulation
